export const initInputMessage = `How to use this text formatter like a pro:

{INPUT_VARIABLE} <- Wrapping text with { brackets } creates a new variable insert point.
{INPUT_VARIABLE} <- You can add the same variable as many times as you'd like.
{MULTI&SELECT&VARIABLE} <- Insert multi-select variables by adding & between options.
!DATE <- Insert the current date like this.

Create a template in the INPUT field, update your variables in the center fields, and then view your formatted text in the OUTPUT field.`;
